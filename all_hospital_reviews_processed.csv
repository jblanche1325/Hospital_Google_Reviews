He said ""ok"" ... as soon as my baby came out the cord was clamped and cut immediatly and the baby went over to the side of the room where I could not even see her for what seemed like forever. The nurse just kept repeating ""we have to put a diaper on her"".

I had a healthy full term baby, for which I am very thankful, but when I think about my birth experience I feel very upset. Women giving birth need to be treated more like human beings. At ft sanders you are led to believe that you have choices but the reality is you have 1 choice, theirs.

On another note they try everything they can to discourage breastfeeding. If you ask to see the lactation consultant, count on seeing them the day before or of discharge from the hospital. You are not important to them. The nurses do not know how to help you get a proper latch and the witches in the nursery will take your baby to ""run tests"" and claim your baby will be gone for 20 min. Almost 1 hour later they brought my baby back and told me they gave her formula!!! Need I add anything else???

Part B= Talking about birth control with the nurse in the office at my check up, she recommended an IUD. I asked her to tell me some of the bad or harmful side effects of it and she said most people dont have a period, so if your one of those people who need to have a period every month then maybe you wouldnt like it.

You are blessed with some wonderful nurses on this floor, Teresa Burns, Sarah Wegrzyn, Laurie Somers, Hope ? and Daniel ? and Greg.  Some of them have been his caregiver each time he has been there.  First time we had met Hope she is wonderful, she was so personable with him they laughed with each other. First time we met Laurie also such a caring and wonderful person, very easy to talk too. Teresa Burns has cared for him before, she is so very special make you feel like you are very important to her. Sarah was always coming into the room to see if we needed anything at all and anytime we needed something she was quick to get it for us.

So grateful for each of them including Daniel and Greg, funny thing about Greg he was the first nurse that Dave met when he was there on the initial visit several years ago, we really like him.

Only thing wrong at Ft Sanders is the food, not enough attention to the quality of food served, too many meals have the roast beef, that was too tough evern for me, always serving squash which had no taste at all.  The instant potatoes tasted terrible. He would only eat the soup that he could get some days. Thank ful that we had his own protein powder that we could mix, per our Doctor.  I had to spend a lot of money to try to find things he would eat from your cafiteria, and the cost is high for the quality of food served.

Fort Sanders,112715556344058297631,"I have had several operations over the past 40 years. The last two were in hospital facilities located in Atlanta. My experience at Fort Sanders regional was so superior that, if judged on a scale of 1 to 10, FSR would receive the 10 and both Atlanta hospitals would be lucky to get a 2 or 3. I don't know how their healthcare professionals do as much as they do in the time available to them, but I can tell you that when you push your call button, someone answers, and someone comes and solves your problem! No one ""blessed my heart"" once! Instead, they executed and then asked if there was anything else they could do. What a concept! I had visits from social workers, the manager of food service, the manager of nursing... Everyone cared and genuinely so. One of my RNs, Ashley, was called in because the admissions through the ER were voluminous during the night shift. She is a typical example of a team player who loves what she does so much that she would not want to work anywhere else because she wants to be part of the TOC Spine and Fort Sanders Regional healthcare deliverable. This tells me that management knows what it is doing to foster such loyalty amongst its healthcare workers! I had two other RNs, both named Allison, and each worked a different shift. They listened, educated and made certain that my meds were delivered on time and sought to make sure that I was as comfortable as possible. While I did a great deal of research before choosing Dr. Patrick Bolt to perform my back surgery, I really did not understand how well the TOC Spine team worked with their counterparts at Fort Sanders Regional until I experienced it firsthand. They work together like a well oiled machine! I even had a most educational visit from Dr. Bolt's Nurse Practitioner and Surgical Assistant, Ashley Self.

Parkwest,115252402653309620303,I went in to park west at 8pm with abdominal pain and other appendicitis symptoms. I was bent over in a wheel chair in the waiting room for an hour before we heard someone else ask if they could wait in their car. They were told yes and the hospital would call when their name came up. We asked for the same and went to our car and waited for a call. During the 4th hour we used the restroom and found out there were still 9 people ahead of me. Went in between 5th and 6th hour to find out we had been taken off the list. No one apologized and they did not put me at the top of the list. We still had to wait for 4 more people before being called back after a 6 hour wait with an appendicitis. I finally got pain meds and had blood work and urine test. Nurses were predicting UTI and hemorrhagic cysts while doctor asked for a CT Scan. I did not appreciate the implication that I was bent over double in pain for things I knew I didn‚Äôt have and did not have the symptoms for. After a 4 hour wait for CT scan and results I was told I would need to have my appendix removed. Before surgery they said it had not burst. After surgery I was told that it did burst before surgery but was folded over and contained but spillage happened during surgery. I guess they are saying they made a patient with a burst appendix wait 6 hours in a waiting room. The surgeon left excessive bruising and prescribed augmentin for post surgery. My GP was not pleased with either. He changed my antibiotics to much stronger stuff. At the post op the surgeon was angry I went to my GP but the surgeons office never answered my questions and I was having a lot of problems 4 days after surgery. When I told the surgeon what meds I was switched to he told me that‚Äôs what he usually prescribed and then he asked me what he prescribed for me. He then never had an explanation for why he prescribed augmentin. Finally the home heath advice was just awful. They told my that I could go to work on a Monday after Friday surgery and they also said to make sure I exercise. They never said to take it easy for a week or to take off for a week. Ever. I was trying to make decisions on work daily before I just gave up and asked off for a week after I still had a lot of pain and a fever on day 4. I never felt like I was improving until the antibiotics prescribed by my GP kicked in. The hospital pumped enough fluids in me to cause a 10 pound weight gain and they gave me Tylenol to mask a fever so they could dismiss me after one day and say I was fine to go because I had no fever. It‚Äôs obvious that insurance companies are more important than patients.,bad,10/29/2020 11:15:34,2,went park 8pm abdominal pain appendicitis symptom bent wheel chair waiting room hour heard someone else ask could wait car told yes would call name came asked went car waited call 4th hour used restroom found still 9 people ahead went 5th 6th hour find taken list one apologized put top list still wait 4 people called back 6 hour wait appendicitis finally got pain med blood work urine test nurse predicting uti hemorrhagic cyst doctor asked ct scan appreciate implication bent double pain thing knew didnt symptom 4 hour wait ct scan result told would need appendix removed surgery said burst surgery told burst surgery folded contained spillage happened surgery guess saying made patient burst appendix wait 6 hour waiting room surgeon left excessive bruising prescribed augmentin post surgery gp pleased either changed antibiotic much stronger stuff post op surgeon angry went gp surgeon office never answered question lot problem 4 day surgery told surgeon med switched told thats usually prescribed asked prescribed never explanation prescribed augmentin finally home heath advice awful told could go work monday friday surgery also said make sure exercise never said take easy week take week ever trying make decision work daily gave asked week still lot pain fever day 4 never felt like improving antibiotic prescribed gp kicked pumped enough fluid cause 10 pound weight gain gave tylenol mask fever could dismiss one day say fine go fever obvious insurance company important patient

A few of my vertebrates replaced with titanium boxes and screws. I was tended to and treated like a king. Never field more pain than I should have always on time with my meds the doctors were very informative.  And I never went hungry ever.

I knew I would be staying the night so I was not giving anyone the keys to my vehicle. No one seems to know which hand is holding the other. I was told pre-op testing would take 45 minutes and 2.5 hours later they still couldn‚Äôt find a vein. The unbelievable part is I did ALL of my pre-op testing the Monday before my surgery at my PC‚Äôs office. The hospital insisted on repeating the test ‚Äú4‚Äù days later. I asked them why ‚Äúrepeatedly‚Äù and they told me because the results came over from my doctor too dark and they couldn‚Äôt read them. I said fax?!?! They said yes! I said, ‚ÄúI thought everything was electronic now?!‚Äù My thoughts....how antiquated and how can your records be secure if they come over an unmanned fax machine? More importantly, if you can‚Äôt read the results PICK-UP the phone and call the doctor, don‚Äôt put the patient through the expense and pain of repeated test! After repeated sticks they still couldn‚Äôt get a vein. I was told to come to the hospital for surgery early so they could stick me AGAIN! I played their game and did as requested and thankfully a very kind man was able to get a vein (it was where I told them it was all along and pre-op wouldn‚Äôt listen). I had, had chemo previously and veins are few and far between. Then they came in and told me I had to have ‚Äú2‚Äù shots in my thigh and one in my spine. They tried to give me oxycodone. I refused as it‚Äôs listed in multiple places as a known allergy. They offered me ONLY Tylenol as a substitute. I‚Äôm willing to bet a million dollars that the oxycodone never made it back to the dispensary. Anyway, I go away to surgery and wake up and my female parts are hurting. I apparently have told my post-op nurse multiple times because she (brown headed nurse with hair just below her ear lobes) told me she heard me and to please ‚Äúshut up‚Äù. The vagina pain is worse then the total knee replacement and after I get to my room a female PA comes in and orders me something and tells me I must have had a reaction to the catheter. This makes sense so I take the meds and I‚Äôm better. Once discharged and back at home I discover (while showering) I have bruises at the top of both of my inner thighs. Either someone got really rough with the catheter or I have no idea what happened. However, the floor I was on had fantastic nurses, but the last day before leaving I was rocking myself in pain and asked when I could get a pain pill.

Parkwest,105718344386353346394,I am so upset with the Senior behavior floor there. My Mom has been treated there for years. She had mental health problems. I took her there May the 8 to the ER. They were great. She stayed there until Thursday and was moved to the Senior behavior floor. I thought they would treat her as they had before. Dr David Seale was her doctor for years. After my father died she had a break down due to his death they were married 65 years. So she thought Dr Seale was her husband so he refused to treat her anymore. Well I just excepted that. Then while she is being treated this time. They didn't give her her Lorazepam and cause her to code blue with seizures and had to move her to the hospital on the 2 ND floor they have done their best with her. This also happened in 2011 when she was there on the senior behavior floor. But what upsets me they refuse to treat her now on the senior floor for her mental illiness. I think it's awful since it's there fault she had the seizure. In 2011 she never had another one until now over the same med. I just feel it's do unfair to my Mother. I was visiting her last night and she was seeing things she had pulled her IV out she could not even understand I had gotten her a watch she had wanted.

They had stopped 2 more meds used for depression cold turkey I believe that was what was going on with her last night.They want to send her to another hospital to treat her that is almost 2 hours away. I just pray they could work this out and treat her. I know it's all in God's hands and he is in control. I know that she could have died that night but he was not ready for her.

He gets to the hospital & they diganoised him wit a small brain bleed but then never talked about doing surgery to fix it, they just left it alone. Well 2 days later, he starts trying 2 respond by answering yes or no questions by squeezing your hand. Well when the Drs found that out they tried making him respond a lot more, so much more that his blood pressure went up to 206/120 (stroke level) & after that he had a fever of 103 & never responded again he was on life support for almost 2 weeks & they kept talking like he had a stroke but never would say he did & then his brain stopped responding to his other parts of his brain & he got 2 where his brain stopped telling him when he was hungry & the Drs said he would stay n that state for the rest of his life. Then found out he had fluid on his lungs. So they did surgery 2 fix that. Well it got fixed but then his oxygen level he was breathing went down & your supposed to breathe on ur own 90% of your body's oxygen & he was only getting 70% & he had to be taken off life support. And I'm convienced the hospital didn't do all that they could that's for damn sure there was so much they could have done but chose not to & wouldn't talk to us about anything until we gripped at them wanting answers. But if u have an emergency, I wouldn't go there that's for sure. They also told me a few yrs ago to have an abortion because my baby wouldn't be breathing when he was born and that it would only be hard on me. Well I said hell no, gave him a fighting chance  & carried him till I was 8 months along & he came out breathing.

Parkwest,114952084762617584824,"My healthy 25 year old son went to Parkwest ER with severe abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, nausea that had become more acute as the week passed.  We had been on a cruise and spent a day in Mexico so of course a GI Multiplex panel to check for bacterial etiologies were ordered.  His symptoms were also indicative for C-diff and asked for the culture be sent  to check for C-diff.  He was told by the ER physician, Dr. Barry Cummings, that he hadn't been on antibiotics or hospitalized so it was unlikely he had C-Diff.  He insisted at the opposition of the ER physician but he finally agreed to check it.  His symptoms continued to worsen, so he saw a GI specialist who performed a colonoscopy.  He had inflammation of the lower intestines but a diagnosis could not be determined until the biopsy results.  In the meantime, Parkwest reported that all cultures were negative and we assumed that included C-diff. We later found out Dr. Cummings never ordered the C-diff culture. His symptoms continued to worsen so he returned to Parkwest ER.  He was admitted and spent 4 days in the hospital being treated with oral antibiotics and IV steroids.  He was seen daily by the on-call GI specialist.  At my insistence, he was released late Wednesday evening on day 4 since no one pursued a diagnosis but just treated symptoms.  His GI specialist requested his records and he was seen the following day.  It was then we realized that Dr. Cummings never checked for C-diff.  His GI specialist sent the culture for C-diff on Thursday and received the positive result on Friday and was finally treated after 4 weeks of missing his pharmacy school prerequisite exams and work.  All of which was costly and could have been avoided if Dr. Cummings would have done what my son asked.  The frightening aspect was that he was not in isolation his entire hospital admission and this is exactly why c-diff is becoming so widespread.  Dr. Cummings is a TeamHealth physician and I asked that they write off the remaining balance due to his negligence that contributed to an unnecessary colonoscopy and hospital admission however the hospital insists that the appropriate processes were followed and of course I am expected to pay for their mistakes.

Took my husband to the ER at Parkwest yesterday (Sunday 8/23/15). He was in extreme pain and we thought it might be a kidney stone. They took us back to an exam room, gave my husband 2 shots (one for pain, one for nausea that was because of the pain), sent in some stuff to the lab, then took him for a CT scan. After we had been there for about 45 minutes the doctor came in to give us the results of the CT and labs. He was most happy to tell us there was ""nothing wrong"" with my husband that his kidney was just fine.....even though my husband was in severe pain. While it is good that he wasn't passing a stone; he was still in severe pain. The doctor stayed in the room for about 10 minutes then left.....a few minutes later a nurse came in to discharge my husband! We had to fight for almost 3 hours to have my husband's pain addressed. At the one hour mark in the fight they offered my husband one pill of a medication he has a severe adverse reaction to (yes, they knew of this because they had been told when we first arrived and they asked about allergies to medicines) and we were told that was what was being offered; and while it was not said out right...it was made quite clear that it was a ""take it our leave it deal"" and that nothing else would be done or offered.  And they kept asking ""Well what do you WANT""; it felt like a complete trap. I told them we are not the doctor, nor are we the pharmacist! You were told what my husband can not take, surely you can look up what can be used instead of the medications my husband can not take due to adverse reactions. We ended up having to call the house supervisor, threaten to call the boss of the doctor on duty and having 4 nurses and a tech go to bat for us. At that point the doctor came back in the room, was extremely condescending changed the ""diagnosis"" from ""renal colic causing your pain"" to ""there's nothing wrong with your kidney"" and ""your pain is not from your kidney"". The doctor would not even consult with my husband's urology group until I INSISTED that he at least speak with them! The doctor on duty made it quite clear he did not believe my husband was in pain and the doctor was not going to listen to anything we, or the nurses, had to say about the matter.
There comes a time in medicine where you need to say: ""Look, here's what we do know: a. b. c. That said, a. b. c. will not, or typically does not, cause the pain you are experiencing. We don't know exactly what is causing your pain, but regardless, you are obviously in severe pain so lets get that under control so that it is tolerable through tonight and you can go to your regular doctor tomorrow."" It is called temporarily (TEMPORARILY, please note..not ongoing) treating the symptoms until the root cause can be found and taken care of.  I know there are abuses in the system, but, not everyone coming through the ER doors with pain is looking to ""score"". This hospital really does need to learn that! That is all we wanted, a little compassion and a tolerable level of pain until we could get to my husband's regular doctors today (Monday). Instead we were treated with contempt, condescension and no compassion at all. My husband was given (after a 4 hour fight) just enough pain control to get him out the door and home so they didn't have to fool with him any longer. That is NOT good medicine.....nothing about our experience was ""good medicine"".
The nurses and other staff were very nice and were as helpful as they could be (without jeopardizing their jobs..I know you can only help so much and then its your job on the line..I worked in medicine).

Parkwest,100324722153926106015,"After blood work, urine sample, and CT scan, my husband's doctor diagnosed him with appendicitis. They gave us an envelope with his medical information and told us to go to Parkwest. The surgeon had been notified and was waiting on us. For some reason we had to go through the ER. We had to explain 3 different times to the ER staff that the surgeon was waiting on us and we already had all the information they needed. They had my husband sign a HIPPA form while sitting on a bed in the ER hallway along with 4 other patients. Then they handed him a gown and asked him if he was shy. When he refused to change into his hospital gown in the middle of the hallway they took him to a closet. After being in the ER for 3 hours the surgeon finally came down to talk to us and admitted that no one told him that he had a surgery waiting. He apologized for the wait.

They took my husband up to surgery 3.5 hours later. The lady that wheeled him up took my number and said that I could wait where ever I wanted and they would call me when he was done. I went to the surgery waiting room to make a couple of calls and was going to go to the cafeteria to get a drink and snack since I had eaten in about 9 hours. I was told that the surgery waiting room was closing and that I'd have to go to a consult room. Then she informed me that I should use the restroom before we go back because there wasn't one back there and I couldn't leave that area because the doors would lock behind me. The surgeon came and talked to me about 40 minutes later and said that someone would come get me in about 45 minutes and take me to my husband. An hour and a half later, I happened to find a guy walking down the hallway and asked him if he could help me. I told him who my husband was and he said, ""He's already in his room. Didn't anyone tell you?"" I spent over 2 hours in a tiny room in a deserted hallway with no bathrooms, no access to food or drink, and no one around that I could even ask questions!!

The day after he was discharged, we realized that he had been given the wrong discharge papers!!!! With the obscene amount of money I'm sure they're going to charge us, the customer service should match the price tag!

Side note - the  young lady that was in the ER hallway beside us was in a neck brace due to a car accident. She had been there at least 2 hours with us. Her mom asked the doctor if she could have something for pain. The doctor's response was ""We'll give her something for pain as soon as we get her in a room.""

Vicki Bale the house supervisor promised me she would check on the lack of care my daughter was experiencing and she never bothered (as all the other nurses for room 381).    So I called her back and she hung up on me.  To be fair I was upset the first time I called - due to the lack of care my daughter was receiving - but she said she would check it out.  She didn't .  She was too busy as she informed my son-in-law.  Nurses would not even bother to help my daughter to bathroom.   Worse health care EVER!  Vicki should be fired or at least demoted!!!

So my son-in-law called patient advocate, he was told the doctor was the best and that was that.

Update, Vicki did call and speak to my son-in-law.  He said she was rude and not helpful.

Second update:  Even though blood work shows my daughter has an infection no antibiotics or any meds given.  Dr. said earlier in day he was checking on cultures. As noted earlier he never came back.  They checked out to find real medical care.  Oh and I tried to call Vicki again, she would not take my call.  Left a vm for administration to call me, want a wager no one will call?

Just had my surgery there, on 12/26/18  due to my doctor only doing surgery at this location. Same terrible experience, forgotten me for supper and breakfast again. Nurse Nancy was super rude, Abby took care of me but it took forever to get help (1 hour at least). Overall, same awful experience...
11/2017- I'm giving 1 star just because I can't post my comments with zero stars. Went to Parkwest Hospital to have surgery, they lost my registration paperwork and I had to re register, right before my surgery. Once I woke up in recovery, had to wait 4 hrs for a room to be available. Then I was left in the room with no water, and the nurse Ann didn't leave the controller for me to call her for help, she also forgot to bring my drink after I ask for it twice. I was forgotten again for dinner, and when I expressed how unimportant they made me feel, nurse Lynda simply smiled at me, and said ""yeah, well, call if you need anything"". No apologies. I was in room 412. My pain medicine was out and the machine beeped for 6 min before someone showed up. I was also forgotten/ skipped for breakfast, they brought me cold coffee about 11 am.Transport guys rushed me over every bump making my wound hurt even more, while chatting and laughing, again no apologies. Just smiles.
Horrible patients care, lots of smiles, but poor attention to details and patient's basic needs.
11/2018 update : due to the short distance from work and considering that I was unable to breathe , my friend had to rush me to the Parkwest E.R last Saturday.
I kept telling them however I could that I couldn't talk, since i couldn't breathe, they kept asking me to talk and to breath. My friend addressed our concern about nurse Greta B. ignoring her when she was telling her that I was passing out, and Greta B. had a cold, rude attitude when responded ""yes, I heard"".
I called for help twice because I needed to use the restroom, nobody showed up. I had to disconnect myself from all of those machines, including the empty IV bag, and had my friend walk me to use the restroom. The 2nd time didn't even bothered calling for help, did the same thing  (after all nobody showed up since I called for help the first time, they never knew I left the room twice) nurse Greta B walked by us but didn't say a word...
Maddy was the only human being who really cared and treated us with respect and acknowledged us. I was so lucky to have my friend who held my hand the entire time and helped me calm down as I was hyperventilating. She tried to ask nurse Greta B why I was itching so bad all over, when Greta responded ""I don't know, but here goes the second drug"". I was too dizzy to remember more details, but there were plenty more. When I was discharged and while getting dressed, nurse Greta B opened the curtains wide open and said ""you are still here, I thought you were gone"". HORRIBLE PATIENTS CARE AND BEDSIDE MANNERS. They did get me to start breathing again and sent me home with meds, but I still don't know what happened to me, because they didn't know either. Nothing changed since my last review.

Parkwest,100519606096719813886,"Unfortunately, over the last 3 years, I have visited multiple Emergency Rooms at different hospitals - including UT, Fort Sanders, Sweetwater General, and Tennova due to injuries from overstraining myself at work.

Because I have a muscle disorder and have a physically demanding job, each visit was related to extreme pain that kept me from working or being able to function - and every single doctor, PA, and nurse treated me as if I were an addict faking an injury for pain medication.

Time after time, I left without answers or any kind of real help.

However, when my neurologist told me to go to the ER over the newest episode of pain that left me unable to sit, stand, lift my arms, or even breath normally without white hot searing pain, we chose Parkwest - and it was hands down the best ER visit I have ever had!!

Not only were we VERY QUICKLY given a room and a dedicated nurse, but Dr.Jeffrey Zurosky came in within minutes of being there to talk to me about my pain and order tests.

Dr.Zurosky was extremely friendly and caring, and listened to my concerns (unlike EVERY OTHER burned out, stressed out ER doctor I had dealt with in the past). It wasn't long after the consult that blood tests, an x-ray, and an EKG was ordered, and I had my results. When those results came in though, it was Dr.Zurosky that PERSONALLY came to see us and explained what was causing the pain I was in.

He then wrote me an effective pain medication that I had never heard of, but works better than similar medications that I have been prescribed in the past.

I would also like to add that our nurse (whose name I should have gotten but neglected to ask - and if she reads this, I apologize for that), was extremely direct, but super gentle and patient with us. As a person that has a fear of needles, I was terrified about getting the IV they ordered to administer the pain medication I needed. But, she was so efficient with it that I BARELY felt the large needle being inserted. Ma'am, again, if you read this - know how much I appreciate you for that.

All in all, I would give Parkwest 10 stars if I could for this visit!! While ER visits are never fun, the staff was quick, efficient, and ACTUALLY helped me instead of treating me like a criminal for simply being in pain.

Thank you Parkwest, Dr.Zurosky, and our fabulous nurse for helping me go from crying, screaming, and unable to breathe - to now sitting comfortably on my couch hours later with only minor twinges of pain while I heal. I now know where to go the next time we are in need of emergency medical service, and will be back if and when the need arises!!",good,07/28/2017 22:30:41,1,unfortunately last 3 year visited multiple emergency room different including ut sweetwater general tennova due injury overstraining work muscle disorder physically demanding job visit related extreme pain kept working able function every single doctor pa nurse treated addict faking injury pain medication time time left without answer kind real help however neurologist told go er newest episode pain left unable sit stand lift arm even breath normally without white hot searing pain chose hand best er visit ever quickly given room dedicated nurse drjeffrey zurosky came within minute talk pain order test drzurosky extremely friendly caring listened concern unlike every burned stressed er doctor dealt past wasnt long consult blood test xray ekg ordered result result came though drzurosky personally came see u explained causing pain wrote effective pain medication never heard work better similar medication prescribed past would also like add nurse whose name gotten neglected ask read apologize extremely direct super gentle patient u person fear needle terrified getting iv ordered administer pain medication needed efficient barely felt large needle inserted maam read know much appreciate would give 10 star could visit er visit never fun staff quick efficient actually helped instead treating like criminal simply pain thank drzurosky fabulous nurse helping go cry screaming unable breathe sitting comfortably couch hour later minor twinge pain heal know go next time need emergency service back need arises

So finally after spending all of this time in the ER he was given a prescription to help with the swelling he was there to see a doctor for. On the way home we were reading the info that came with the prescription and he can't take the medication because it will cause problems with his Parkinsons medication.

Parkwest,113256760064184854756,"My father had heart surgery @ Park West and was not treated well by the nonsurgical staff there.  In addition to that, a staff member@  Park West assured my father the hospital would arrange to have public (ETHRA) transportation for him  available upon his discharge from the hospital since 1) due to long distance from his residence and 2) being that no one else in the family due to work obligations and my mother due to a disability, unable to transport him home.
Prior to his dismissal he was refused any breakfast and wasnt dismissed from the hospital until 3 hours later.
Another 3 hours had passed until we were finally able until to reach a friend of ours pick my father up from the hospital and bring him home. In addition to the hospital not scheduling transportation home for my father and not being served anything to eat were  brought to the attention of  Social Services department who took no action to correct the situation.
Overall, the  problem seem to lay with Social Services as they failed to contact ETHRA to transport him home. When ETHRA was contacted by another family member to confirm this, ETHRA stated no one @  Park West ever contacted them. The folks in Social Services Department especially Emily were not helpful to say the least and that is where most of the blame is due to poor communication on their part. Neither I, nor any of my family will EVER recommend this hospital to anyone. Our family had scheduled to have ETHRA to transport my father to the hospital and would have scheduled to have him transported back home but the hospital staff assured the family and my father that they would contact ETHRA themselves which the hospital failed to do.

However, the experience we have had is simply EMBARRASSING. I'm so embarrassed... The sad excuses for nurses(Sara) and for CNAs(Rachel and Breanna) were so rude to my mom. We waited 45 minutes for someone to come in after we pushed the call light. And we had to keep track of when she was due for pain meds???? Isn't that their job? I found myself refilling my mom's water, helping her with bathing and getting dressed, making her bed because the nurses and CNAs were too busy gossiping at the nurses station. Everyone else in our hall was getting extremely frustrated by the lack of attention any employees were providing. When my dad would ask a simple question like ""her temp is really high, is that bad?"" they simply replied ""well it's not common usually"" and walked out.

I was raised in East Tennessee and have been there several times. Most times have been mostly satisfactory. Not great. Never above and beyond just I didn't die. But this last visit was absolutely the worst experience I've ever had at ANY medical facility. As I entered the waiting area, there was no one there and I was taken back immediately for chest pain. The nurse at the front desk was very nice as was the triage nurse. They got me to a room and began hooking me up to the machines ans got an EKG. They all seemed very attentive. Then the doctor came in and began to ask my medical history. Surgeries..etc.. When I explained to him I had had a heart valve replaced 10 years (almost 11 years) ago, of course he wanted to know why. I told him it was because of poor decisions when i was younger. Meaning i am a recovering addict. That's when everything shifted. Right then I knew what I was in for. The ""oh sweetie can we get you anything?"" Turned into they were too put out by a ""junkie"". Ten years clean pr not. The doctor kept asking me ""you don't do that anymore do you?"" I told the man that if I did, I would be dead. It has been 10 YEARS. The nurse's attitudes all changed. They removed needles from the room as if i were going to steal them to try and get high. Even just asking to go to the restroom seemed to put them out. I have never been so humiliated in all my life. It is one thing had I'd been in active addiction. But a completely different story to be treated so unfairly because i once WAS an addict. I hope no one ever has to go through what i just endured.

LeConte,107477841787950771468,"On the day of August 31st 2018, My husband Henry A Padgett and I, Brandi R Padgett, arrived at Le Conte Hospital for a scheduled Csection at 6AM.  I had to wait until 11:30 AM for the operation to get underway.  Upon the beginning of the operation I went into the operating room and my husband was made to stay outside of the room as they administered the spinal tap.  My husband did not have the understanding or clarification as to why he was not allowed to be in the room during the only part of the whole procedure that scared me and couldn't be there for my comfort or support.  When he approached the doctor and asked he was not given an answer as to why this was the case, even though he was allowed into the room during the actual operation and that it made no sense.  When he asked the doctor, Jennifer Anderson Maddron, she rolled her eyes and walked away without answering.
Henry then walked to the car to take a breath, and upon returning the nurses informed him that he was not allowed into the operating room any longer,or the room that I would return to after surgery.  After he was escorted out of the building they told me that he got his stuff and left with no explanation.  I was heavily medicated upon the end of my surgery well into the next day, and the staff at the hospital would bring my son to me and leave him in my arms for hours before returning to get him.  I was trying to keep myself awake after holding him for over three hours but I felt myself getting really tired.  I tried to call for a nurse and none ever came.  I held my son from almost 3AM until 6:15 AM and fell asleep.  I woke up as he fell from my arms and tried to catch him but all I managed to do was break his fall somewhat.  Then a nurse finally came running into the room because I was screaming and my son was crying.  I feel like my son and I were neglected by the staff at this hospital and my husband was treated very horribly as well.  I would not give birth here ever again and I pray for anybody who does.

I came to LeConte expecting help but NO I get an incompetent doctor who could not remember what he was treating me for and acted very stuck up to me. I went to LeConte having major back pains, an elevated heart, an infection that caused me to barely pee, dizziness and a strained back where I can not stand more than a minute or two. I AM 23! The staff there treat you like a burden, don't give you a damn thing for your infection and don't remember what they are doing. I had to ask them if they did the pregnancy test that is mandatory for any woman over the age of 11. The idiot doctor didn't ask if they did one. So I ended up 2 more hours at the hospital and another pee test. Now I find out at 6pm after being there since 2:25 that I am a mother. The doctor says well dont be too excited your hgc's are low so you could miscarry or have a tubal birth but hey come back in 48 hours. Again no antibiotic at the hospital so when i am finally released at 8pm I have to suffer til morning because the pharmacies are closed. But hey! I was due to be released at 6:45! I could have made it! So I go back after two excruciating days of waiting and the triage rn that is doing the vitals tells me that most women miscarry their first child. I didn't ask her a thing. She asked what I was here for and made that snide comment. Well I wait forever with the same symptoms and an even higher heart beat, go back to the same doctor as two days ago who wrote on my paper I was there for a repeat ultrasound and the idiot said oh. I didn't do that I told her to get you a repeat blood test. He passed the damn buck! So the hgc's come back very high and the baby is okay. I hug the doctor and say thank you and he says don't get too excited, hands me a paper and leaves. I am a first time mother, this will be my first it was absolutely crushing!!!!

I made sure that other cars could pass by but that didn't matter I still got a parking ticket. I marched right back in there and got the security on the phone and told them what to do with his ticket too. There was nothing the doctors could have done to save my baby girl and I understand that. But the way I was treated after her death made everything so much worse. We got a pretty nice new hospital but with the same horrible treatment and care. If you can with stand the drive to UT I highly recommend so. If you must go to Leconte pray you get one of the very few doctor's there that actually care about their patients.

I call everyday and talk to his nurse's and they are just all God sent The doctor's call with update I'm on crutches from foot surgery. My sister and niece visit him. They have treated us so good. I will never forget the loving care they have shown my Father. They are the Best. God puts people where they need to be and I feel the Lord has Blessed us with all the doctor's and nurses there. I really appreciate the work they did Thursday evening when he got there. They had to give him 12 units of blood and so many units of plasma. I think that is how much. We were afraid he would not live until morning. The hard work and loving care they gave him and the healing touch of Jesus Christ he is off of life support.

I have tried to get not care to the patient but some sort of regular interaction between nursing staff and loved ones and that is where the break down begins.  I understand what terminal means.  I understand and do not expect a reversal or insta-cure.  But I do expect a certain level of humanity regarding information to the family as they gather around a deathbed.  I understand there may be no new information regarding the patient, but why not check in on the family.  Tell them what their loved one is experiencing.  Reassure them.  Help them through this.  Based upon the lack of communication in this area I can say that where ""customer service"" is concerned, they are in need of a staff-wide refresher.

Two of them I just got off of 2 days before.  He said, ""You spend too much time Googling medical issues online.""  SURE I've looked into why I'm having a nervous breakdown!

They had another woman there that night that they finally had to lock up, call the police...and she SCREAMED the whole time.  I couldn't handle it.... in my condition..and the DOCTOR kept repeating...""Well, there's nothing we can do about it.""  Basically, just pooh-poohing my breakdown.  It was his ATTITUDE that blew me away while I sat their crying.  By 5AM, after suffering all night long, all they had done for me was given me two sleeping pills and one bag of saline.  They ran blood work which they said was ""normal"" (never told me what they ran) so they couldn't keep me.  WHY COULDN'T THEY HAVE SENT ME TO A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE COMPASSION OR THE KNOWLEDGE TO DEAL WITH WHAT I WAS GOING THROUGH?? We have good insurance...so that wasn't the issue.  I think the Doctors there are so used too seeing bullet wounds or bleeding heads, that they don't have the training to deal with a problem like mine.  We got home at 6AM.  This is Monday..this all happened last Wed. We have still not recovered from being up all night and I'm worried the stress will literally kill my husband. We got into a new Dr. last Friday and I am being sent (probably) this week to some sort of facility to help me get off this terrible Xanax. We are in our 60's and dehydration, malnutrition, stress and Xanax are life-threatening conditions when all combined.

Oak Ridge,117203310118599046853,"March 9th will mark the third year of my Mother's passing. I would not recommend MMC to anyone other than the leader of ISIS. My Mother was at MMC for 13 days. I am still haunted by the Sunday when I entered the room to find her crippled and immobile arm, since birth, laying at her side. I immediately summoned her nurse & CNA in order to find out why this had taken place since they had known  her arm would not bend. No one seemed to know or want to admit they were aware of anything. I requested to see her MMC doctor and the nursing supervisor. It was only much later when I became quite vocal in the hallway that anyone came. Lip service is the norm when dealing with an obvious error by hospital personnel. No one apologized since that would have meant some degree of responsibility. The following days prior to my Mother's passing were heartbreaking. She was so protective of her arm. The alarming part is that force would have to been used to straighten her arm. I had to intervene on several occasions when lab techs came to draw blood, that the arm did not move. Those treating her were aware as well. Three years later and I am still sickened by the fact that MMC staff hurt my Mother. After her passing, I requested a face to face meeting with her MMC doctor and nursing director. I was advised that no recording devices were allowed,  but MMC personnel did take notes. Again, I heard lip service. Sorry for your loss blah, blah, blah. My Mother's MMC doctor showed me a xray on his phone, supposedly from my Mother's old records, showing her arm fully extended. Still to this day, I am beyond  disbelief, that a physician would stoop to this level. More so too, he presented himself as a man of faith to my family during the time he was treating my Mother. Then, the MMC doctor stated that the nursing home where she had lived for the last 3 years had corroborated that her arm was indeed mobile. Another outright fabrication. Needless, to say nothing was resolved during the meeting. I am leaving the readers of this review with one final paraphased statement made by the MMC doctor, ""get over it and move on"". I left the meeting in tears. No one, other than close family members, know what the past 3 years have been like for me. My only hope is that my story helps keep someone else's loved one out of danger. I have omitted the names of the MMC personnel involved.

Several hrs later he felt much worse so he was taken to UT where he was xrayed and has pneumonia and tested positive for Covid19.
If this was the 1st negative experience here maybe I wouldn't write a review. But after numerous bad experiences I sincerely hope they never go here again.
When I called to inform them of his diagnosis the 1st lady was super nice and transferred me to I think the charge nurse who was cold and justified their diagnosis of a possible kidney stone and colic. No apology or say I hope he recovers quickly-no remorse for their care that has now put many others at risk. I even told her I realise no one is perfect and mistakes can be made but my layman experience has seen many cases of pneumonia to be diagnosed through an xray. If they did a CT scan why would an additional chest xray be so hard? Btw, he has excellent insurance and when he requested a Corona test they said it wasn't necessary bc he had no confirmed exposure to anyone with the virus.

My grandmother showed signs of a stroke, and it was brought to the attention of every nurse and doctor that I spoke to, yet they diagnosed it as a UTI. She was disoriented, her right arm was completely useless, she was literally out of her mind. I'm sure she did have a UTI, but given the circumstances, why would they not check for a stroke? I brought her home after she stayed there for around 4 days (during her stay they almost gave her twice as much medication as instructed on TWO OCCASIONS). She comes home and is gradually recovering, the right arm is still completely inoperable, and 4 days later my grandmother has a severe stroke and I have her flown to UT.

If you had a question, they direct you to ask someone else who also doesn't know. Finally left unseen and untreated because I felt I was more capable of handling the allergic reaction than the hospital.

Worst part for me is I am from out of town. So I'm in a strange place, having a semi panic moment with my child who is having this allergic reaction. And no one even checked on the child to see if there was any immediate threat. Even if someone would have acknowledged the child, it could have made the situation easier.  But instead as symptoms slowly subsided after the benadryl. I just left. This place is a JOKE.

The hospital staff said there was one doctor there who was working as fast as they could. I do understand busy and order of patients are seen according to severity. Statistically 40% of children who experience an allergic reaction to a food need a treatment such as ephedrine  (epipen).

Morristown Hamblen,104226031074340196677,"UPDATE: When I checked in I gave them my address as I should. After 2 months and a hospital visit of 4 days of excruciating pain, I made the decision to move in with family so they could help me with my daughter. I informed the hospital the day after I left, of the change of address and a month later, I was contacted by collection agency! Turns out that the people living at my old address sent the bill back to hamblen as return to sender and immediately it was turned over to collections! They sent it to the wrong address! Now my credit is lowered and they will not reverse it citing ""policy"". I pay my bills thank you. You failed, again to do your job. I did my part and informed you of my address all you had to do is enter it in the account. Seriously, you had ONE job....

I am extremely dissapointed. I was accused of using drugs and treated as a drug addict. I was not treated for the reason I came in. I was bullied by the staff. I was treated as if I was scum and I assure you I will NEVER go here again. I am an evangelical pastor and to be treated rudely because a nurse hates Christianity was unacceptable. My religion is my business (and no I didn't bring it up until the drug test) and never have I been talked to like she did me. I came in for extreme pain in my side and I was not even treated for that. They ran test after test because I had staph and because of my blood pressure even though I did not want to. They ignored my side and would not even address it. The nurse said I was a drug addict and told me I failed my drug test. I will NEVER trust a urine test again. I run a drug and alcohol treatment program at my church andvto be told I was using drugs was ridiculous. When the doctor came into my room shaking mad because I argued with the nurse over my drug test was unprofessional! I asked to test my blood if they wanted to accuse me and they refused. Instead the doctor flew out of my room saying he won't help me if I said one more word. I am disgusted with the experience. (Except the ER doctor who was a blessing) I left the hospital with my side still causing great pain because they thought I wanted drugs! I was fortunate to locate a doctor (good Shepard clinic in sevierville) who, in only 2 visits, found the problem.(holes in my stomach bleeding and leaking acid inside me) but this hospital couldn't find that in a week?! Then I get sent a bill I can't afford for treatment I didn't want. I am having to pay these people to be rude to me?! If you took your car to a mechanic and asked him to look at the breaks and instead he puts a new motor in, while your brakes are still out, would you pay him? these people left me in excruciating pain for 3 months all because of the judgment they placed on me by my appearance. Shame on you. You people have gotten out of hand. Your job is to treat me for why I came in. If I say I am not on drugs then you treat me as if my problems are not drug related!

I went in last week to the ER and I had excruciating pain in my right upper abdomen. Turns out it was my gallbladder failing and I had to go to a different hospital and get surgery eventually.

After that I left and went home and came back the next day because I had the same problems. Well then they did more tests and turns out I‚Äôm throwing up and in so much pain because I smoked weed. That made me laugh. So they gave me medication and they admitted me just to get more money out of me. I told them myself I thought It was my gallbladder and so they were going to do a HIDA scan but wanted to do an upper scope first. They did the upper scope and told me it was gastritis. I was so mad so I left because they just kept giving me pain medicine. I also pressed my nurse button and it took someone at least 30 minutes. I even pulled my emergency cord in the bathroom and they didn‚Äôt come until about 30 minutes later. What if it was a serious emergency? The doctors are rude and they don‚Äôt care about you.

Keep in mind this facility doesn‚Äôt have a cath lab or a cardiologist. Her heart rate dropped into the 30‚Äôs and still no concern from the physician. According to him she still wasn‚Äôt ‚Äú urgent‚Äù enough. We asked for transfer and the physician was appalled by our request . Anyone who cares would want their family member transferred to a higher level of care. The nurses even stated they would leave also. Another incident was when the front desk clerk called security because she thought there was more than 2 people in her room. The security guard who rudely opened her curtain without knocking ( what if she was naked) was ready to throw someone out he said ,‚Äù oh, I was told there were more than two people in here‚Äù it is sad that this facility cares more about how many people are in a room but didn‚Äôt even react when her heart rate dropped into the 30‚Äôs. We ended up having her discharged and drove her to another hospital where she received the care she needed . I feel bad for this community, they need more resources and more experienced doctors. I will say our nurse was a shining star throughout the whole experience. The doctor, security and the front desk clerk need to find new professions .",bad,10/10/2018 12:55:28,3,worst emergency room experience family member heart attack er doctor insisted stay facility wait cardiology next morning instead transferred higher level care keep mind facility doesnt cath lab cardiologist heart rate dropped 30 still concern physician according still wasnt urgent enough asked transfer physician appalled request anyone care would want family member transferred higher level care nurse even stated would leave also another incident front desk clerk called security thought 2 people room security guard rudely opened curtain without knocking naked ready throw someone said oh told two people sad facility care many people room didnt even react heart rate dropped 30 ended discharged drove another received care needed feel bad community need resource experienced doctor say nurse shining star throughout whole experience doctor security front desk clerk need find new profession

Claiborne,105997685835951016869,Very poor service. Few people if any waiting on a ultrasound. We were 15 mins early for my wife's appointment. Really don't think it should have taken an hour and forty-five mins. to get a ultrasound done. But at least the technicians were very nice. Normally I don't rate anything and give most places plenty of time because there may be other people in worse shape that need help. But that made the third time we've had to have images or x-rays made and it takes forever. It's not the wait that bothers me its the medical condition and sitting forever.,bad,08/15/2017 15:57:09,1,poor service people waiting ultrasound 15 min early wife appointment really dont think taken hour fortyfive min get ultrasound done least technician nice normally dont rate anything give place plenty time may people worse shape need help made third time weve image xrays made take forever wait bother condition sitting forever
